simple matrix multiplication tests with multiple tile sizes. Tested on gcc (15) and ~~clang~~. default gcc on github actions does not work well with this program. note: different compilers reacts to tile sizes differently. requires a c++23 compatible compiler for stdfloat. clang doesn't have stdfloat so i guess download the version without bf16 support.
